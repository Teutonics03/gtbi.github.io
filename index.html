                      <p>The feasibility study was completed on the same year through the financial support of DOST-PCASTRD (Philippine Council for Advanced Science and Technology Research and Development) now known as PCIEERD or the Philippine Council for
                        Industry, Energy and Emerging Technologies Research and Development. With about 38 incubatee-respondents, a Business Plan on the GTBI was made through the technical support of TRC and the all-out support of then President Pablo
                        E. Subong, Jr. We were then on the process of finding financial support for the construction of the building.

                      <p> The first steering committee meeting attended by the Iloilo City Government, DTI, DOST, TRC and CHED was done in July 16, 2013 to approve the operation manual. Dr. Rowena Cristina L. Guevara, Executive Director of DOST PCIEERD with
                        the able support of Ms. Russell M. Pili, made possible the funding of 8.6 million pesos for the equipment and operation cost for two years (2014-2016) of the facility . Dr. Luis M. Sorolla, current WVSU President made possible
                        the WVSU counterpart of more than six million pesos for additional facilities and equipment and completion of the four-storey building. Thus the NPBI will officially start on December 16, 2014 with five incubatees.
